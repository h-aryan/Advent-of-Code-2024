# ðŸŽ„Advent of Code 2024 Solutions ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my repository for **Advent of Code 2024**! This repository contains the solutions to the daily challenges for this yearâ€™s Advent of Code.

## Overview

Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve a series of programming puzzles, one each day, from December 1st to December 25th. The puzzles are typically algorithmic and challenge your problem-solving and coding skills.

## My Approach

As I work through the puzzles each day, I will solve the problem, write my solution, and post it here. Iâ€™ll be updating this repository regularly as I progress through the challenges. 

## Plan

- I will aim to solve each day's problem as soon as it's released.
- Solutions will be posted after Iâ€™ve completed each challenge.
- Code will be written in JS.
  
Check back regularly for updates as I work through the Advent of Code 2024 puzzles!

Happy coding and good luck to everyone participating!
